### Background of the Data

Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parent heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. He originated many statistical terms and concepts, including regression, correlation, deviate, quartile, and percentile, plus median for the midpoint of a distribution. The `galtonheightdata` dataset was [created under the direction of Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) using Galton's [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing the measurement data. You can access the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets from their [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page, which also contains variable definitions.

### Create Analysis Datasets

#### Dataset #1

Load the `galtonfamiliesmain.csv` and `galtonfamiliessub.csv` datasets above under the **Setup** header and use `glimpse()` to explore their structures. Use your code from Project 1 and/or draw from the Project 1 solutions to assemble a dataset below that meets the following criteria. Use `datatable()` from the DT package to display the result.

* contains these variables:
   * `familyid` = ID number of the family, with `136A` recoded as `205`
   * `num_children`= the number of children in the family
   * `father_ht` = the height of the father
   * `mother_ht` = the "transmuted" (per Galton) height of the mother
   * `midparent` = the average of the parents' heights
   * `child_sex`= whether the child is a son or a daughter, all lower case
   * `child_ht` = the height of the child with daughter heights "transmuted"
   
* is arranged according to:
   * ascending order of familyid
   * sons before daughters within family
   * in order of height within each sex of child

```{r assembledata1}

# Prepare data_sub to match data_main
data_sub <- data_sub %>%
   mutate(Father = FatherR + 60,
          Mother = MotherR + 60,
          Height = HeightR + 60) %>%
   select(FamilyID, Children, Father, Mother, Child, Height)
data_sub$FamilyID <- as.character(data_sub$FamilyID)

# Join data_sub and data_main
data_fams <- bind_rows(data_main, data_sub) %>%
   
   # Wrangle combined data_fams
      # ... For `rename()`: `<tidy-select>` Use `new_name = old_name`
   rename(
      num_children = Children,
      father_ht = Father
   ) %>%
   mutate(
      familyid = replace(FamilyID, FamilyID == "136A", "205"),
      familyid = as.double(familyid),
      mother_ht = (1.08 * Mother),
      midparent = (mother_ht + father_ht) / 2,
      child_sex = ifelse(Child == "Daughter",
                        "daughter",
                        "son"),
      child_ht = ifelse(child_sex == "daughter",
                        1.08 * Height,
                        Height)
   ) %>%
   select(
      familyid,
      num_children,
      father_ht,
      mother_ht,
      midparent,
      child_sex,
      child_ht,
   ) %>%
   arrange(desc(child_ht)) %>%
   group_by(familyid) %>%
   arrange(desc(child_ht, by_group = TRUE)) %>%
   arrange(familyid)

datatable(data_fams)
#str(data_fams)
```

#### Dataset #2

Select the variables `familyid` and `num_children` and reduce the dataset so that it contains only one row per family. Again, use `datatable()` from the DT package to display the result.

```{r assembledata2}

family_count <- select(data_fams, familyid, num_children) %>% distinct()

datatable(family_count)
```

### Part 1: Parent/Child Heights

#### Galton's Visualization

In his original paper (linked above), Galton created several tables and diagrams. His "Diagram Based on Table 1" of them is similar in concept to a scatterplot. Rather than dots, he grouped/tabulated the data, and then used the count of how many people were grouped at the coordinate pairs in his grid, with child as the x-axis and mid-parent as the y-axis. There are two scales: inches and deviations from 68.25 inches.

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/galtonplot.png")
```

#### Updated Scatterplot #1

Create a scatterplot of child height (x-axis) versus mid-parent height (y-axis). Ordinarily, we might reverse the axes here because analysts would be more likely to model child height as a function of parent height, but we want to be able to compare the updated plot to Galton's original. Make your dots larger than the default and adjust transparency (`alpha`) to correct for overplotting and help show the density of points. 

Also include the following.

* use `color` in the `aes` to differentiate sons versus daughters
* use `scale_color_manual()` to choose two informative colors
* scale both axes so that there is a tick mark at every whole inch
* use `coord_fixed()` so that the axes have the same unit spacing
* add better x- and y-axis labels, including the units of measure
* add an informative title (you may optionally include a subtitle)
* add `color =` to `labs()` to set the legend title to `"gender of child"` 
* use `theme_linedraw()` to add some additional plot formatting
* use `theme()` to move the legend to the bottom of the scatterplot

```{r updatedscatterplot1}
ggplot(data_fams, aes(child_ht, midparent, color = child_sex)) +
   geom_point(
      alpha = 0.3,
      size = 2
   ) +
   scale_color_manual(
      breaks = c("daughter", "son"),
      values = c("lightseagreen", "mediumvioletred")
   ) +
   scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 20) +
   scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 11) +
   coord_fixed() +
   theme_linedraw() +
   theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      legend.position = "bottom"
   ) +
   labs(
      title = "Heritability of Being Tall", 
      subtitle = "Gender-adjusted heights of offspring in relation to that of the parents",
      color = "Gender of Child",
      x = "Height of Adult Child (Inches)",
      y = "Average Height of Parents (Inches)"
   )
   
   
```

#### Updated Scatterplot #2

Remove the color coding for sons versus daughters from your plot, as well as any other coding related to it. Instead, choose n single color for the points and adjust both `size` and transparency (`alpha`) as needed to correct for overplotting and help show the density of points. Reset the `aes` so child height is the `y` variable and midparent height is the `x` variable. Add a fitted *straight* line to the plot. Update your `labs` accordingly.

```{r updatedscatterplot2}
ggplot(data_fams, aes(midparent, child_ht)) +
   geom_point(
      alpha = 0.2,
      size = 1.8,
      color = "steelblue"
   ) +
   scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 11) +
   scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 20) +
   theme_linedraw() +
   theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
   ) +
   labs(
      title = "Heritability of Being Tall", 
      subtitle = "Gender-adjusted heights of offspring in relation to that of the parents",
      x = "Average Height of Parents (Inches)",
      y = "Height of Adult Child (Inches)"
   ) +
   geom_smooth(
      method = "lm", 
      formula = "y ~ x", 
      se = FALSE,
      color = "grey25",
      size = 0.4) +
   coord_fixed()

   
```

### Part 2: Number of Children

Create a barplot to show the distribution of the number of children per family. Set the bars to something other than the default `width`. Scale the x-axis so that there is a tick mark for each bar. Choose appropriate colors, labels, themes, and/or and other types of formatting that you feel will enhance the meaning or visual appearance of the plot.

```{r childrenbarplot}
ggplot(family_count, aes(num_children)) +
   geom_bar(
      color = "red",
      fill = "red4",
      width = 0.875,
      xlim = c(1, 15),
      ylim = c(0, 32)
   ) +
   scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 20, minor_breaks = NULL, expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 20)) +
   scale_y_continuous(n.breaks = 7, minor_breaks = c(0:35), expand = c(0, 0), limits = c(0, 35)) +
   theme_linedraw() +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
   labs(
      title = "Number of Children per Family in Glaton Study Participants",
      x = "Number of Children in Family",
      y = "Number of Families With x Many Children"
   )
```

## Questions

**Question 1:** Do you think that your scatterplots are an improvement over Galton's original diagram? Are there any modifications and/or additions you would make to enhance the clarity or usefulness of your plots?

**ANSWER**

At a glance, it's a little bit easier to see the data on the scatterplots than in Galton's.  The Galton plot contains essentially the same information, but requires closer examination to read the density in each grid square.  Galton's plot contains more information with the axes being in both absolute scales and deviations, but in some ways this simply makes the graphic more complicated and distracts from the core data.  It's not clear from looking at Galton's ploth what the major/minor axes and tangeltl lines are meant to represent.  It might be helpful for my plot to include a labeled y = x line which would show the trend if children were (on average) the same height as their parents.  The difference between the trend line and the y = x line would illustrate the regression coefficient:  children of short parents are taller than one might initially expect, while children of tall parents tend to be shorter.

**Question 2:** Explain the rationale behind the choices you made when creating your scatterplots and barplot, such as size, color, transparency, or other features. What motivated your decisions? 

**ANSWER**

When selecting transparency for the first scatterplot, I wanted to pick a value that would be dark enough to see single points easily, but allow at least three overplotted points to be discernable.  A value of 0.3 means that more than 3 points make the mark entirely opaque, but it's possible to tell the difference between one or two or three or more.  For selecting colors, I decided not to use pink and blue, although the stereotype associated with that color choice has advantages.  Ultimately I selected a purple-and-green palette based on the suggestions from <a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/gendercolor/">this article</a>, and these colors should be differentiable with most forms of color blindness.  If the sex of the child were particularly important to the meaning of the graph, a different shape could be used as well, making the plot entirely color-independent.  

I chose bright colors for the second scatterplot and bar plot because bright colors naturally draw the eye.  I tried to make the axis labels descriptive enough that no additional information would be needed to understand what was being conveyed.  For the bar chart, I set the minor grid lines on the y-axis to be every 1 family, because the "x-axis"number of families" is inherently an integer value, and having grid lines every 2.5 units (or other awkward or un-intuitive units, like 1/10ths of a foot) is one of my pet peeves, and makes it needlessly harder to read the data.

**Question 3:** Considering best practices, how does using `coord_fixed()` enhance the authenticity of the information shown in the scatterplots, such as the relationship and spread of the data?

**ANSWER**

Both axes are in the same units, and viewers will intuit (and/or assume) that the scales are the same.  Using `coord_fixed()` makes sure that an inch on the y-axis is the same as an inch on the x-axis, which prevents the trend line from being distorted by stretching the axes to fit a standard rectangular view, and makes it easy to see the elliptical clustering of the data.  If the minor axis (y-axis in the first plot) were stretched out, the distribution would appear more circular, i.e., completely random around a central point.

## Visualizations

### Background of the Data

The datasets were downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You can find the links to their descriptions in the `docsreference` folder.

### Create Analysis Datasets

Complete and run the two scripts found in the `docscripts` folder. Your processed datasets all should be written into the `dataprocessed` folder. Load the resulting `.Rdata` file above under the **Setup** header and use `glimpse()` to explore the structure of each dataset.

#### Dataset #1

The `dplus` dataset contains a variable that gives information about the `rating` for each program offering. Convert the variable into a factor that puts the ratings in (roughly) ascending order of age restriction/audience: `TV-Y`, `TV-Y7`, `TV-Y7-FV`, `TV-G`, `G`, `TV-PG`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `TV-14`. If the `date_added` variable is not already in date format, convert it.  

```{r factorratings}
dplus$rating <- factor(
  dplus$rating, 
  levels = c("TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-Y7-FV", "TV-G", "G", "TV-PG", "PG", "PG-13", "TV-14"), 
  ordered = TRUE
)

```

#### Dataset #2

In the `strmtv` dataset, create a new variable that tells you the total number of streaming services that offer each included program.

```{r numberofsvcs}
strmtv %>%
  mutate(
    num_svcs = Netflix + Hulu + `Prime Video`+ `Disney+`
  )
```

### Part 1: Violin Plot

Create a violin plot of `release_year` (x-axis) grouped by `type` of program (y-axis) for programs on Disney+. Fill with a color of your choice. Add a boxplot inside the violin plot, as you did in one of the DataCamp exercises. Re-scale the x-axis so that tick marks appear at whole-decade intervals (e.g., 1980, 1990, 2000). Add an appropriate title and axis labels. Use other formatting as you choose to enhance effectiveness/appearance.

```{r}
ggplot(dplus, aes(release_year, type)) +
  geom_violin(bw = 1.5, fill = "purple1") +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0, fill = "transparent") +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
   theme_linedraw() +
   theme(
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
   ) +
   labs(
      title = "Number of Programs Released by Year", 
      x = "Year Released",
      y = NULL
   )
  
```

### Part 2: Waffle Plot

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/shrekdonkey.gif")
```

Create a waffle plot to show the distribution of program `type` on Disney+. 

* Give the plot the title "Streaming Content on Disney+". 
* Change the colors of the squares to something other than the defaults.
* Use an x-axis label to indicate roughly how many programs each square represents.

Hint: You can use `count()` to find out how many of each `type` of program there is, then use `prop.table(n)` in a mutate statement (along with some other math) to get percentages. Other methods are also possible.

```{r}
prog_counts <- dplus %>%
  count(type) %>%
  mutate(percent_type = round(n / length(dplus$type) * 100))

prog_percent <- prog_counts$percent_type
names(prog_percent) <- prog_counts$type

waffle(
  prog_percent, 
  colors = c("tan4", "goldenrod1"),
  xlab = paste("Each square represents approximately ", round(length(dplus$type) / 100), " programs", sep = ""),
  title = "Streaming Content on Disney+")
```

### Part 3: Bar Plot

Create a horizontal barplot to show the frequencies of the various `rating` categories for programs on Disney+ (i.e., use `y =` rather than `x =` for the variable you are plotting). You will need to remove a couple `NA` values first. Use faceting by `type` so that you have side-by-side plots for the different program types. Add an appropriate title and axis labels, as well as other formatting of your choice to enhance effectiveness/appearance. 

```{r}
rating_clean <- dplus %>%
  drop_na(rating)

ggplot(rating_clean, aes(rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "deepskyblue3",
           fill = "deepskyblue4",) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap( ~ type) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lavender"),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "lavenderblush3")) +
  labs(title = "Ratings of Programs on Disney+",
       x = "Program Rating",
       y = "Number of Programs",)

```

### Part 4: Another Plot

Use one of the sets that contains data about the TV shows available on various streaming services to compare the quantity of Disney's TV show offerings to the quantity of offerings on other streaming services. Use a plot of your choice to enhance the effectiveness/appearance of the plot.

```{r}

ggplot(strmtv_long, aes(Service, fill = Service)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(
      breaks = c("Disney+", "Hulu", "Netflix", "Prime Video"),
      values = c("darkorchid2", "green3", "firebrick2", "dodgerblue")) +
  labs(title = "Number of TV Shows on Selected Streaming Services",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Number of Programs")


```

## Questions

**Question 1:** Based on your plots, make five informational statements or comparisons regarding the Disney+ streaming service.

**ANSWER**

1)  The earliest television programs on Disney+ came out in 1955.

2)  Disney+ has more than 2 movies for every TV show (although the data doesn't show whether TV shows have more episodes).

3)  Television shows on Disney Plus are never rated G or PG-13, but movies can be of any TV-rating.

4)  The number of offerings on Disney+ is dwarfed by the major streaming services' catalogs.

5)  (See Appendix B) Overall, the critical rankings of shows on Disney+ is similar to that of other streaming services:  mostly average, with more really bad shows than really good ones.  Prime video has nearly as many offerings with terrible reviews as Disney + has in their entire TV catalog.

**Question 2:** What other data would you like to have, or which existing variables would you like to see transformed, if you were going to do further explorations or visualizations? Give at least two examples.

**ANSWER**

The number of hours of content, broken down by type, would be really useful for making more accurate comparisons between streaming services and between movies and TV shows offered on each service.  I would also like data on genre to make comparisons between services.  A separate category for animated vs live-action would also be interesting, although these are not mutually exclusive because some films blur the line between the two.  These both/and programs, however, make up a small portion of the total dataset, so they probably won't badly distort comparisons, but it would be something to watch out for when assigning proportions that assume an either/or distinction, especially if they are over-represented in certain genre or ratings categories.
